# DM001_MandTrainDB
Implement a mandatory training database in Access 2016

Version controlling (VC):
-------------------------------
-> To allow git VC, all files must be saved in a marked down text format.
		1. MS Word documents: Markdown generated using Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/)
		2. Spreadsheets are saved as .csv files
		3. MS Access files (containing VBA code etc): conversion to markdown text using msaccess-vcs-integration (https://github.com/timabell/msaccess-vcs-integration)
		
		
Governance files:
-----------------------
Governance files used are not yet officially approved by the CRQC and may need to be ammended accordingly.
